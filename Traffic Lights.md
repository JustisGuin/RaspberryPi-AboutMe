   -You need to take the button and line it up where the legs are going into 2 and 4 right under e 
   
   -Put other side of the legs under the g

   -Now you Want to Grab a male to male wire 
   
   -Plug it in the right side negative on 5 and the other side right beside the right side of the button on 2 under

   -You are going to connect the white wire (or what ever color it is) to d,4 
   
   -Connect the female side to the Pi then connect it to the GP2 connection
   
   
# Connecting the Lights to the Bread Board 

   ## Red Light
   
   ### First Step
         
   <img src="https://github.com/JustisGuin/RaspberryPi-AboutMe/blob/main/images/Image%20from%20iOS.jpg" height="400px" width="500px"></kbd>
   
   
   -On the right side on the Bread Board connect the red light short side on the - between 15 and 16 
   
   -Connect the Long side of the red light on J,15
   
   ### Second Step
   -Connect the resistor (either way) on H,15 and then the other side on the left side of the board on E,15
   
   -Your going to take a female to male wire and connect it right next to the resistor D,15
   
   -Connect the female side of the wire to the GP25 connection on the Pi 
   
   
   ## Yellow Light
   
   ### First Step 
   
   <img src="https://github.com/JustisGuin/RaspberryPi-AboutMe/blob/main/images/Image%20from%20iOS%20(1).jpg" height="400px" width="500px"></kbd>
   
   -Connect the short side on the yellow light to the - inbetween 21 and 22
   
   -Connect the long side to J,21
   
   ### Second Step 
   
   -Connect the resistor (either way) on H,21 then on the left side of the board on E,21 
   
   -Your going to take a female to male wire and connect it right next to the resistor D,21
   
   -Connect the female side of the wire to the GP8 connection on the Pi 
   
   ## Green Lights
   
 
   ### First Steps 
   <img src="https://github.com/JustisGuin/RaspberryPi-AboutMe/blob/main/images/Image%20from%20iOS%20(2).jpg"  height="400px" width="500px"></kbd>
   
   -Connect the short side on the green light to the - inbetween 27 and 28 
   
   -Connect the long side to J,27
   
   ### Second Step
   
   -Connect the resistor (either way) on H,27 then on the left side of the board on E,27
   
   -Your going to take a female to male wire and connect it right next to the resistor D,27
   
   -Connect the female side of the wire to the GP7 connection on the Pi
